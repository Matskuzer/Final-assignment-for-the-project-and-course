### Completed Labs

- File upload vulnerabilities â†’ Remote code execution via web shell upload  
- SQL Injection â†’ Retrieving hidden data  
- Cross-site scripting â†’ Stored XSS into HTML context  
- Authentication bypass â†’ Brute-forcing a login  
- Access control â†’ Insecure direct object references  

*(Add more as needed)*

### Reflection  
PortSwigger's labs gave me hands-on experience with web application vulnerabilities. I especially gained insight into how attackers exploit common weaknesses and how to mitigate them. The interactive labs were crucial in reinforcing the theoretical concepts from the course.

## The Booking System Project

### Project Phases

**Phase 1:**  
Explored the booking system, identified features and initial bugs.  
- What worked: UI was responsive  
- What didnâ€™t work: Limited error handling  
- Time-consuming: Understanding legacy codebase  

**Phase 2:**  
Improved error handling, revised the backlog, and added more test cases.  
- What worked: Testing caught several logic flaws  
- What didnâ€™t work: CI integration was slow  
- Time-consuming: Writing meaningful tests  

**Phase 3:**  
Authorization and penetration testing using OWASP ZAP and wfuzz.  
- What worked: Found unauthorized access flaws  
- What didnâ€™t work: Some tools gave false positives  
- Time-consuming: Manual testing and verification  

### Reflection  
This project taught me how to manage and improve an existing application securely. I learned a lot about secure coding practices and penetration testing workflows.
