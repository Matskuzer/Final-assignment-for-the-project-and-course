## The Booking System Project

### Project Phases

**Phase 1:**  
Explored the booking system, identified features and initial bugs.  
- What worked: UI was responsive  
- What didn’t work: Limited error handling  
- Time-consuming: Understanding legacy codebase  

**Phase 2:**  
Improved error handling, revised the backlog, and added more test cases.  
- What worked: Testing caught several logic flaws  
- What didn’t work: CI integration was slow  
- Time-consuming: Writing meaningful tests  

**Phase 3:**  
Authorization and penetration testing using OWASP ZAP and wfuzz.  
- What worked: Found unauthorized access flaws  
- What didn’t work: Some tools gave false positives  
- Time-consuming: Manual testing and verification  

### Reflection  
This project taught me how to manage and improve an existing application securely. I learned a lot about secure coding practices and penetration testing workflows.
