🧾 Completed Labs
File upload vulnerabilities → Remote code execution via web shell upload

SQL Injection → Retrieving hidden data

Cross-site scripting → Stored XSS into HTML context

Authentication bypass → Brute-forcing a login

Access control → Insecure direct object references
(Add more as needed)

✍️ Reflection
PortSwigger's labs gave me hands-on experience with web application vulnerabilities. I especially gained insight into how attackers exploit common weaknesses and how to mitigate them. The interactive labs were crucial in reinforcing the theoretical concepts from the course.

🧩 The Booking System Project
🧱 Project Phases
Phase 1:
Explored the booking system, identified features and initial bugs.
What worked: UI was responsive.
What didn’t work: Limited error handling.
Time-consuming: Understanding legacy codebase.

Phase 2:
Improved error handling, revised the backlog, and added more test cases.
What worked: Testing caught several logic flaws.
What didn’t work: CI integration was slow.
Time-consuming: Writing meaningful tests.

Phase 3:
Authorization and penetration testing using OWASP ZAP and wfuzz.
What worked: Found unauthorized access flaws.
What didn’t work: Some tools gave false positives.
Time-consuming: Manual testing and verification.

✍️ Reflection
This project taught me how to manage and improve an existing application securely. I learned a lot about secure coding practices and penetration testing workflows.
