## The Booking System Project

### Project Phases

**Phase 1:**  
Explored the booking system, identified features and initial bugs.  
- What worked: UI was responsive  
- What didn’t work: Limited error handling  
- Time-consuming: Understanding the applications

**Phase 2:**  
Improved error handling, revised the backlog, and added more test cases.  
- What worked: I got passwords cracked  
- What didn’t work: Everything worked fine  
- Time-consuming: Password cracking  

**Phase 3:**  
Authorization and penetration testing using OWASP ZAP and wfuzz.  
-   I haven't done this yet, but I'm still going to do it. I just need Phase 3 returnbox opened. 

**Phase 4:**
Authorization and penetration testing using OWASP ZAP and wfuzz.

-   I haven't done this yet, but I'm still going to do it

### Reflection  
This project taught me how to manage and improve an existing application securely. I learned a lot about secure coding practices and penetration testing workflows.
